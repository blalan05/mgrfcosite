The job of a millwright is to repair, install, or reassemble machinery at a site or facility. Because of the nature of this job, our Millwrights have to have a wide range of abilities and a depth of understanding to properly and efficiently improve our customers' equipment in any way possible. As highly skilled workers, MGRF Millwrights use a wide diversity of tools ranging from hand tools to forklifts.

>The problems that you may come across, could be a chance for us to not only help you, but to improve you.
