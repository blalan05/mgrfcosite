## Bulk Unit Maintenance & Repair

We have a dedicated team of experienced Repair Technicians with a supporting crew that can help you get back to operational condition in a timely manner.
Some of our repair services include: Remote Control, Hydraulic Hoses, Belts, Tarps, Augers, Lights & Electrical, Motors, Chains, and more.
We service a complete overhaul. That means we facilitate every single component that makes up a bulk feed body truck. From electric to mechanic to maintenance to replacing whole vehicle panels/parts, weâ€™ve got you covered. We generously service different brands that include our competitors. If that was not enough, our Blast Room puts us at the front of the line by granting us the capability to blow away rust and then throw on/affix paint back where you want it/it belongs.
You can submit an electronic Bulk Truck Repair Request using the button below.  Submitting online will help us fit you in our schedule with the appropriate technician.  It also ensures that we meet the specific needs of your truck.  Thank you for helping us to serve you better.
