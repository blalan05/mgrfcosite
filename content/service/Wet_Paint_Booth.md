We have a 14’ wide by 14’ tall by 35’ long (we can go longer in some cases) state-of-the-art spray booth for applying wet paint. The booth includes an advanced curing cycle that can cure a freshly painted item in 2 hours. We have used our space to paint everything from small sprockets to large garbage trucks.
