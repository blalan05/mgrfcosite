## Waterjet

Our waterjet operates at 60,000 PSI, cutting material with water and garnet. We cut many of our own parts and have extensive experience cutting signs on our waterjet. The waterjet is capable of cutting multiple material types at varying thicknesses. It has been used to cut wood, metal, plastic, & granite (including an 8‚Äù thick piece of granite).
