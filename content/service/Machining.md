## Machining

We use manual lathes, drill presses, milling machine, and a CNC machining center. Machining helps eliminate complications, makes production easier, and provides accuracy. Our high-end machinist can use many machines like lathes, milling machines, and grinders to turn bare stock into a custom part. 
<br>
Machinists use CNC by writing a program in G-code that reflects the sketch made with a customer. The computer reads this code and then forwards it into the interface that gives the servo-motors directions on where and how far to go in order to drill or mill the material. Precision vices hold the material onto the table which moves the material around for the blade in the spindle to obtain precise cuts. 
<br>
We make use of both Solidworks® and Mastercam® technology to produce detailed parts. Whether your job requires small or large quantities, we can help you.
Shafts make up to primary parts that customers ask for. When farmers or contractors need parts for antiquated construction or agriculture equipment, we are the go-to. This is because we care about our customers, get the parts to the customers right away, and tend to be cheaper than other options. Custom parts are a common occurrence due to our customers creativity and ingenuity which we can easily cope with. 
> When other machine shops won’t give you the time of day, we are the first to step in and lend a hand to get your ideas onto paper and into reality.
