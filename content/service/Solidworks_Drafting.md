We rely on our state-of-the-art Solidworks® system and our draftsmen to take your idea from conception to completion in a detailed fashion. Solidworks® is a computer-based program that is used to draw 3D interactive models starting from scratch. When algebra is used to get the correct dimensions and thickness of the model, a blueprint is made out of this prototype and the parts are cut out on a waterjet. They can then be cut minutely on a CNC mill before they are welded together and assembled to form a life-size version of the model. We take the time to get a solid understanding of what you need and have in-house draftsmen that make sure to keep you involved so you are able to receive exactly that. We are capable of producing drawings that require only one item, or hundreds of items with multiple sub-assemblies.

>Solidworks is beneficial as a visual aid because it shows exactly what the finished product will look like and can even help with conciseness of a mill since Solidworks can diagram the entire mill and place everything where it would be most advantageous. If you have an imagination, you can make it!
