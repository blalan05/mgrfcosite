        <p>MGRF (Midwest General Repair & Fabrication), formerly Jakel Company, has been a family owned and operated business since 1945. Jakel Company began as a welding, repair and blacksmith shop in Reeseville, Wisconsin.</p>
        <br />
        <p>The company became involved in plumbing and heating in the early 1950’s and in the late 1950’s became a supplier and installer of feed mill equipment. This led to servicing feed and grain equipment and manufacturing Jakel feed and grain equipment in the 1960’s. The first feed body was developed in 1969. Jakel Company also had a sideline small engine and snowmobile business that began in the 1970’s, but the primary focus remained with the installation, repair, and fabrication of feed and grain equipment.</p>
        <br />
        <p>In 2003 the Jakel family sold the business to Jon Schrock, a former employee, who changed the name to Midwest General Repair & Fabrication. Jon now works alongside his son Will. Members of the Jakel family continue to fill key roles at MGRF today.</p>
        <br />
        <p>MGRF has continued to focus most of their efforts into honing skills and expertise in the area of equipment design, fabrication, and repair of feed and grain equipment. However, MGRF has led many custom equipment design, repair, and fabrication projects in various fields such as Feed Mills, Ethanol Plants, Milk Replacer Facilities, Egg Production Sites, Concrete Mixing Plants, a Drywall Mixing Plant, Fertilizer Plants, Conveyors and Equipment for a State-owned Power Plant, Milorganite Bagging Plant, Carbon Bagging Facility and continues to reach into new scenes.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Many of our customers have experienced decades of both service and loyalty and we look forward to adding you to our family of satisfied customers.</p>
